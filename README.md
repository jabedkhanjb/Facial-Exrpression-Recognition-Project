Facial Expression Recognition Project

This repository contains the codebase for a Facial Expression Recognition project. The project focuses on developing a robust system for automatically recognizing and categorizing facial expressions in images. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is trained on diverse datasets to accurately identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

Key Features:

    Deep Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for accurate facial expression recognition.
    Data Augmentation: Implements data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization and performance.
    Pre-trained Models: Offers pre-trained models for quick deployment or fine-tuning on custom datasets.
    Evaluation Metrics: Includes scripts for evaluating the model's performance using standard metrics.
    Documentation: Comprehensive documentation to guide users through setup, training, and deployment.

How to Use:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Follow the provided documentation to set up the environment and dependencies.
    Explore and utilize the pre-trained models or train the model on your custom dataset.
    Integrate the model into your applications or projects for facial expression recognition.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements. Let's work together to enhance facial expression recognition capabilities!
